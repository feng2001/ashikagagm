<h1>"Help!"</h1>

Help, I need somebody<br>
Help, not just anybody<br>
Help, you know I need someone, help<br><br>

When I was younger (So much younger than) so much younger than today<br>
(I never needed) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone), I'm not so self assured<br>
(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors<br>
<br>
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
And I do appreciate you being 'round<br>
Help me get my feet back on the ground<br>
Won't you please, please help me<br>

(Now) And now my life has changed in oh so many ways<br>
(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze<br>
(But) But every now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure<br>
(I know that I) I know that I just need you like I've never done before<br>

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
And I do appreciate you being 'round<br>
Help me get my feet back on the ground<br>
Won't you please, please help me<br>
<br>
When I was younger so much younger than today<br>
I never needed anybody's help in any way<br>
(But) But now these days are gone (These days are gone), I'm not so self assured<br>
(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors<br>

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
And I do appreciate you being round<br>
Help me, get my feet back on the ground<br>
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, ooh<br>
